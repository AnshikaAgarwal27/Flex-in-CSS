The justify-content:
This property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on
 the main-axis (horizontally).


The align-items property:
 In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).
In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.


The gap property:
The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. 
It is a shorthand for the following properties.

It specifies the direction of the flexible items.
Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.


The flex-wrap property:
It specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect
